# Accessibility Features

The Accessible Cookie Banner is designed with accessibility as a primary feature, not an afterthought. This document outlines the key accessibility features implemented to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.2 AA standards.

## ARIA Implementation

### Banner Component

- Uses `role="region"` to define it as a distinct section
- Includes `aria-label="Cookie Consent"` for screen reader identification
- Uses `aria-live="polite"` to announce changes to screen reader users

### Modal Dialog

- Uses `role="dialog"` to identify the modal as a dialog
- Includes `aria-modal="true"` to indicate it's a modal dialog
- Provides `aria-labelledby` that references the modal title
- Correctly implements `aria-hidden` states when toggling visibility

### Button Elements

- The "Customize" button includes `aria-haspopup="dialog"` and `aria-controls` attributes
- All buttons have clear, descriptive text (not using icons alone)

## Keyboard Navigation

### Focus Management

- Focus is automatically placed on the first interactive element when the modal opens
- Focus is trapped within the modal while it's open (users cannot Tab outside of it)
- Focus is returned to the triggering element when the modal is closed
- Focus states are clearly visible with high-contrast outlines

### Keyboard Controls

- All functionality is accessible via keyboard-only navigation
- The ESC key can be used to close the modal
- Tab order follows a logical sequence
- No keyboard traps in normal banner operation

## Visual Design

### Color and Contrast

- All text meets WCAG 2.2 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Focus indicators have sufficient contrast (3:1) against all backgrounds
- Interactive elements have visual states for hover, focus, and active
- Multiple themes are provided, including a high-contrast theme

### Text and Typography

- Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- No information is conveyed by color alone
- Line heights and spacing ensure readability
- Font sizes use relative units (rem/em) for better scaling

## Cognitive Considerations

### Content & Language

- Clear, simple language is used throughout
- Technical terms are minimized
- Options are clearly labeled with their purpose
- Instructions are provided when needed

### User Control

- No auto-dismissal or time limits
- No automatically moving content
- Clear feedback is provided after user actions
- Error messages (if any) are specific and helpful

## Internationalization (i18n) & Flexibility

### Language Support

- All text is customizable via locale files
- Supports right-to-left (RTL) text
- Accommodates text expansion for translations (buttons won't break layout)

### Responsive Design

- Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Reflows properly at different viewport sizes
- Accessible at 320px width (mobile devices)
- Works with browser zoom up to 400%

## Technical Implementation

### Semantic HTML

- Uses proper heading structure
- Uses semantic HTML5 elements where appropriate
- Form controls are properly labeled
- Lists are used for related items

### Progressive Enhancement

- Core functionality works without JavaScript (if server-side rendering is used)
- Maintains structure when CSS fails to load
- No reliance on mouse-specific events
- All interactive elements are focusable

## Testing & Validation

The banner has been tested with:

- Automated testing tools
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Zoom and text resizing
- Various UI themes and contrast modes
